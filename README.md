To-Do List with Drag & Drop and state management. 
A simple task tracker that allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 
The project uses React and the React Beautiful DnD library for smooth dragging of tasks between "Completed" and "Incomplete" lists. 
Each task is saved in localStorage, ensuring that changes persist after page reloads. 
The app features a responsive interface with customizable styles and animations.
